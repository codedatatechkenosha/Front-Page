# Open-Data-Kenosha
Public created and managed site that collected data about public organizations and representatives in a unified and aggregated format

The inspiration for this project was a friction that exist in the lives of most citizen. The citizens who are interested in having a greater 
awareness and context to the everyday operations and impact of their representatives. The representatives in government, municipal operations,
law enforcement, and law. This is not to be an exhaustive list but rather a picture of the things that citizens have a right to know. 

While citizens may be interested in having a greater awareness of local activity, and the information may be available, the access to the 
information may not be readily accessible or digestable. Indeed you can find the records for your local aldmerman and their voting record. The 
isssue is the time it would take to gather this information and the effort to compile each of their voting "transactions" into a strategic view.
Citizens have little strategic insight into many things at the municipal level. The intent is to provide a forum where citizens can come together
to create solutions.

The visionaries in the community can present ideas for what information should be available, and how the community should self manage this.

The builders in the community can provide the coding and engineering skills to deploy solutions through the internet to the public

The maintainers in the commmunity can faciliate public face to face sessions to ensure that the initiative is connecting to the public
